3. In the left menu, click Event Policies. The Event Policies dashboard appears.
4. In the dashboard, click the name of the policy you need to edit. The Policy Details page for that policy will appear.

## Policy Details

The Policy Details page provides both an overview and detailed information about a given policy. You can view important details about the policy, modify the policy, and take various actions on the policy.

At the top of the page, a status icon next to the policy name indicates whether the policy is active or not. The page includes the following main areas, which are all editable:

- Overview
- Resources & Events
- Users & Integrations

These are described in detail below.
